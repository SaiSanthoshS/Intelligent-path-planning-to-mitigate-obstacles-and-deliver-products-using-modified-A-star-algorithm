Computational advances in micro unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with monocular camera is huge. A micro unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone, is a flying machine that typically has a camera and ranges in size from small toy drones to large military aircraft. The task of controlling these machines often requires the use of path-planning algorithms. Lots of work focuses on path planning with that monocular camera in real-time [11], but it is very difficult to accomplish with conventional methodologies. In detail, the suggested method is based on the efficient search algorithm used to find the optimal path between two nodes in a graph also it is an extension of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The proposed paper presents a novel approach for efficient and effective path planning of drones using a modified A* algorithm. The primary objective of the algorithm is to find the shortest and safest route from the source to the destination, while also minimizing the likelihood of collisions or accidents during the flight. To accomplish this, the algorithm employs a technique of creating a maze of the location where the drone is to be flown, which serves as a visual representation of the obstacles and potential hazards in the environment. The modified A* algorithm considers the unique features and capabilities of drones, such as their ability to fly over obstacles, hover in place, and change direction quickly. The algorithm considers the drone's flight dynamics, including its maximum speed, turning radius, and battery life, to find the optimal path that meets these requirements. Moreover, the algorithm incorporates a set of heuristics that reduce the computational complexity of the search, resulting in faster and more efficient path planning
